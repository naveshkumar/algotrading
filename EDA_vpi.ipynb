Hence if I am analysing Half Hour 20; I am working with assumption of Delivery at 09:30:00 +00:00. the DeliveryStart column is based on this logic and follows the Gate Closure file-wise accordingly. However, the file naming convetion is in UTC, so the file that contains the last trade before 9.30 AM is in a file named _8_30. I will handle this TZ shift in the backend."
